This app is a study aid which uses the following workflow to make study time more efficient 
and avoid wasting time on questions you already have correct.

1. a user enters the questions, answers, and etc they want to study.
2. The user studies these questions until they are ready to take the quiz. 
3. The user takes the quiz. 
4. The user receives a grade from the questions they successfully completed. 
5. The the questions they successfully completed are automatically removed from the queue of questions to study and moved to another queue of completed questions.
6. The user moves views questions that they got right by luck or are not comfortable with back to the queue of questions they still need to study.  
7. The user then returns to the queue of questions that still need to be reviewed and repeat the workflow until they are ready to get a perfect grade on their upcoming test!

Additional features: 

Deleted questions are sent to a deleted questions queue. These can be undeleted by the user.
